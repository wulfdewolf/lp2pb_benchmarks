# lp2pb_benchmarks
The benchmarks that were used in the evaluation of the [lp2pb tool](https://github.com/wulfdewolf/lp2pb).

Each family contains an encoding.asp file and an instances folder that contains the instances.
The families are those of the [2015 ASP competition](http://aspcomp2015.dibris.unige.it/benchmarks-suite-and-selection) (except for track 4) and those of the [2017 ASP competition](http://aspcomp2017.dibris.unige.it/index.php/benchmarks-suite-and-selection). Only decision and optimization problems were used.
The 2017 selection was used for the instances.

The 'Combinatorial' folder contains some separate benchmark families that we created ourselves.
